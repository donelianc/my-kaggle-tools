    "# Discovering Insights from Chess Games\n",

    "**Primary Objective**: Perform exploratory analysis of chess game data to understand distributions of player skills, outcomes, openings, and basic play patterns before constructing an Elo prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw Data**: Portable Game Notation (PGN) files containing moves from 25,000 expert chess games, player Elo ratings, openings, and Stockfish evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan**:\n",
    "* Compute summary statistics on games: lengths, results, openings, theory depth\n",
    "* Visualize Elo distributions and correlations\n",
    "* Sample games across the Elo spectrum and inspect move patterns\n",
    "* Validate data integrity: correct notation, valid moves, matched results\n",
    "* Identify anomalies: incomplete games, duplicate matches, odd evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learnings**:\n",
    "* Game length, result, and opening trends for different Elo levels\n",
    "* Imbalances and biases in player populations or outcomes\n",
    "* Adherence to opening theory by players of varying skill\n",
    "* General play patterns and trajectories in games\n",
    "* Data quality and completeness for modeling\n",
    "* Peculiar games or moves that require investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we gotta check out how good the players are, what moves they tend to make, and how their games usually turn out. Once we've got a good sense of all that, we can dive deeper into the data and start figuring out what's really going on. This will help us spot any problems and establish a solid analysis foundation."
